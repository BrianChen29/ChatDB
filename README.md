# ChatDB
Final project for USC DSCI551


### Introduction
ChatDB is an interactive application designed to teach users how to query database systems (both SQL and NoSQL) using natural language inputs. It will act as a learning tool that provides example queries, allows users to run queries, and returns results from databases like MySQL (for SQL) and MongoDB (for NoSQL). The system can handle natural language inputs, generate SQL or NoSQL queries based on predefined patterns, and execute them, displaying results to the user. Users can also upload their datasets, which the system will store in databases and make available for querying. The project will integrate NLP capabilities with database systems to allow easy query generation and execution.
